            <p>Folding knives are more convenient to carry than fixed blades and don't get in the way. However they are not as strong and have more moving parts for rust to attack.

            <p>Fixed blades are stronger than folding knives. They also don't have any moving parts to jam. However they are not as convenient as folders and can get in the way if carried on the belt. This also requires you to wear a belt.
